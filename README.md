Based on: [Add AMAZING Animations with LottieFiles - SO EASY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8WW0DDXZ4w)

This is first attempt to work with [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/), collection of animations designed for [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) (following their site, Lottie is an iOS, Android, and React Native library that renders After Effects animations in real time, allowing apps to use animations as easily as they use static images.)
